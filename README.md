![DaTableSQL](http://netmask.it/DaTable.jpg)

An ultra thin layer over relational databases that doubles their functionality and ease, by adding temporality, built-in support for undo-redo, "travel-in-time" and versioning, support for modern data types such as tags and code, inclusion of the schemes and meta data in the DB tables, etc.

The layer is written in PL/SQL, and can be inserted to existing database in one command, without changing anything in the lower layers (the database and the data), or the upper layers (e.g. the applications).

DaTableSQL is the basis of the new DaTableJS Web&Mobile framework, and withot it, DaTableJS could not be so easy and powerful.
