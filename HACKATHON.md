### Dependencies:
- [DaTableSQL](https://github.com/marmor/datable.sql)

### Goal:
During this hackathon, we plan to release the first (and preliminary) release of [DaTableJS](https://github.com/marmor/datable.js).

### More Detailed Plan:
- Consult with the hackathon's croud, whether to base the alpha on an existing framework or library (only temporarily!); such step may save time on the rest of the day, but the price is a dependency which must be removed in the following releases ([Meteor](https://www.meteor.com) could be a great option, but its dependency on MongoDB (before Apollo) complicates it)
- Create basic menu component, based on jQuery and other libraries, plus basic routing
- Create grid component, based on jQuery and an existing grid
- Create minimal REST on the backend, based on NodeJS, currently without any auth\*
- Enable CRUD operations on the data by connecting the grid to the backend
- Build a minimal app, based on the above

# IMPORTANT!
## The result of this hackathon is going to be **VERY** preliminary, not representing our plans for this project in any way!
